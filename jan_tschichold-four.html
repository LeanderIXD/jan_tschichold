                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p id="1">From publishing some of the most influential modern Typographical books to redesigning the classical and elegant Penguin books, the avant-guard German typographer, Jan Tschichold, left his mark on Typography and design as we know it. With an unmeasurable self-worth and strong opinions, Tschichold burst into the scene leading movements that where to shape standards and redefine typography for over 40 years.</p>

        <section id="early-life">
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p id="1">Born in Leipzig, the centre of the German book trade, to a signwriter the young Jan Tschichold instinctively became interested in print and typography. He quickly began studying in the “Leipzig Academy of Arts” in 1919 and developed extraordinarily quickly. Soon after he got a job creating work for the Leipziger Messe and set up a business as a typographic consultant.</p>
            <p id="2">Surrounded by the development of the new <i>“-isms”</i> in art Tschichold became curious. The Bauhaus, founded by architect Walter Gropius as a school of arts and it the near city of Weimar, opened their doors for a public exhibition in 1923 which featured works prominently imported from Russian Constructivism and the Dutch De Stijl movement. The Bauhaus school of art was revolutionary in the use of design and typography with one of their main mantras being “art and technology, a new unity”. In comparison to his work up to this point, the work he saw must have been mind blowing to a young man who’s work incorporated classical serif font with little structure. Jan Tschichold remember coming away from the exhibition “in a state of great agitation” after reading a quote.
            <blockquote>“Typography is communication through print”<br><cite>—László Moholy-Nagy,1923</cite></blockquote>

            <p id="3">In response to what he had seen he adopted a completely new style incorporating rigorous structure and composition, and layouts filled with white space, straight lines, and thick rules. With his newfound inspiration or possibly hatred for the sloppy layouts of his time he began developing and pushing propaganda for the new typography movement. He then travelled Europe spreading his ideas with designers and typographers alike. Eventually ending up in Berlin where he published his first major work, <i>“The New Typography”</i> in 1928.</p>

            <h2>The New Typography</h2>
            <p id="1">Jan Tschicholds first book, <i>“The New Typography”</i> which remains published, and translated to English was a masterpiece of modern graphic design, amassed huge popularity among designers and printers all around Europe. His revolutionary ideas challenged traditional practices and pushed the boundaries of what was thought to be capable. With heavy inspiration from the work of teachers at the Bauhaus Tschichold set forth rules for the standardization of modern type practices, including paper sizes and the use of hierarchy in the development of new typographic works. Alongside this he condemned the use of all typefaces except for sans serif pushing his manifesto that</p>
            <blockquote>“The purpose of all typography is communication”<br><cite> —Jan Tschichold,The New Typography,1928</cite></blockquote>
            <p id="2">It is more evident here than ever the effect that the Bauhaus’ Moholy-Nagys had on Tschichold as a designer. This version of Tschichold saw the future and rapidly adapted and adopted the movement becoming one of the leading figures associated with new typography, which soon lead to his temporary imprisonment and the destruction of his published books as the Nazi party rose to power in 1933 for his opposition to stereotypical German design. With the help of German Police officer, he escaped over the border where he found no trouble in finding a job using his reputation and previous teaching post. As war began to rage work became short in demand forcing him to direct his creative energy in other directions. During this time, he published several more books, one of which being the highly anticipated, <i>“Typographic Design”</i> which was released in 1935.

        <section id="change-in-pace">
            <h2>A Change in Pace</h2>
            <p id="1">Towards the end of the 30’s Tschichold began to weaken the influence of the Bauhaus and in turn his first book <i>“The New Typography”</i>. These two covers perfectly depict the evolution of his work during this stage and reincorporation of serif typefaces and symmetrical layout transitioning it fantastically into a classical format with most modernity stripped completely.</p>
            <img src="img/img1.jpg" alt="An example of Jan Tschicholds change in style" id="img1" />
            <p id="2">With his return to a classical refined style Tschichold received an invitation from Allen Lane of Penguin Books to redesign and create a set of guidelines for future and existing books. Penguin was currently far from unsuccessful and rapidly growing. They lacked only one key feature, design. Tschichold understood the importance and responsibility of his undertaking, being the first to redesign such a large amount of content only feasible due to the new technology available in mass printing, and with this the necessity to keep the key characteristics of the Penguin books. After creating a four-page guid concerning all things from margins to italic, punctuation to footnotes, and a new grid system, Tschichold received some resistance. Although in comparison to his previous works this was a mild change, the British designers took great insult in a German man telling them how to design their books.</p>
            <p id="3">A year after starting work at the penguin studios his colleagues began to listen and apply the rules and guidelines he set out, which prompted the rework of the covers. Beginning in 1948, different weights of Gill Sans where used removing the original extra font Bodoni Ultra which was used for the title. Alongside this the tone of the infamous orange strips was changed, strict rules for the tracking of text was established, the Penguin logo was redrawn, and all fonts where adjusted in size to use the golden ratio. Although he continued his use of regimented layout throughout, Jan Tschicholds take on the Penguin books was incomparable to any of his previous work.</p>
